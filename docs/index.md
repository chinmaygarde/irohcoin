## How to Acquire

You may trade for it from other coin holders, but that is **not** recommended!

Iroh will give you some coins if he likes you. Bribery goes a long way with him. He like treats, belly rubs, and playing in the park.

Give him your [Ethereum wallet address](#instructions) and he may give you some coin.
