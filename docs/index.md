## How to Acquire


!!! warning
    Like any other ERC20 token, you can [trade for IROH ](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency={{usdc_token_address}}&outputCurrency={{iroh_token_address}}&exactAmount=1&exactField=input) coins on a decentralized exchange (DEX). But that is **not** recommended.

Iroh will happily give you coins if he likes you. He like treats, belly-rubs, going to the beach, and playing in the park. Bribery goes a long way with him.

Give him your Ethereum wallet address. Set up your own wallet using the [instructions below](#instructions).
